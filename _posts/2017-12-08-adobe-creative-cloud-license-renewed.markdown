The license for the Creative Cloud Suite from Adobe has expired on December 1, 2017. Unfortunately, we did not have the new license available before this date, so some people have seen licensing issues with Adobe programs.

## Affected applications

The following applications are affected by this issue:

* All Creative Cloud applications
* Acrobat DC
