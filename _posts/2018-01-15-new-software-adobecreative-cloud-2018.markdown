Adobe Creative Cloud 2018 is available for all VU employees running macOS 10.12 and higher. The following applications are available:

- Adobe Illustrator CC 2018
- Adobe Photoshop CC 2018
- Adobe Indesign CC 2018

## VU Software Center

Here is a quick link to all Adobe Software installers: [Adobe Software](munki://developer-Adobe)

## License reset tool

Due to some licensing issues that we could not fix with the standard Adobe tooling, we now made available a License reset tool. This tool will remove all Adobe licensing information from your Mac. After the tool has erased the information, please run 'Update' in VU Software Center to automatically re-install the license package.
