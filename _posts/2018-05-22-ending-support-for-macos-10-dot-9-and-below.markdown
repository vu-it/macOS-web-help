Last week we ended the support for macOS 10.9.5 and below. If you want to use VU Software Center, you will need to be on macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher.

## macOS 10.8 and 10.9

If you're on macOS 10.8 or 10.9 you will see the VU software packages but with a note saying that you need to upgrade your OS.

## macOS 10.7 and below

If you're on macOS 10.7 or lower you will see an empty VU Software Center.

## How to upgrade your OS

Please revert to the Apple documentation on how to upgrade your Mac. The possibilities for upgrading depend on the type and age of your hardware. See https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/

## Note on security

For security reasons, always try to keep your machine on the latest version of macOS.
