Today we sent out a new license for ATLAS.ti, valid until March, 27 2019. The license will be automatically installed on your computer if you have ATLAS.ti installed via VU Software Center. 

## On Campus

Due to licensing restrictions, the license file can only be replaced when your Mac is connected to a campus network (wired or via WiFi)
