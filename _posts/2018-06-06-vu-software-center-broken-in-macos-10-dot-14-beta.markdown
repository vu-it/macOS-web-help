Monday june 4th, Apple released a beta for the upcoming macOS version 10.14 called 'Mojave'. 
This update unfortunately breaks VU Software Center at the moment, so you will not be able to install software or updates if you run macOS 10.14.

The developers of munki, the project that underlies VU Software Center, are busy fixing the issue. Be advised that you will need to reinstall VU Software Center if you are running 10.14 as we will not be able to update it automatically.
