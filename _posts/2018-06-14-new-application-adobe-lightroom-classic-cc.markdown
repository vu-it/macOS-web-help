Adobe Lightroom Classic CC is available for all VU employees running macOS 10.12 and higher.

For more information about this program, visit the [user guide for Lightroom Classic](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/user-guide.html).

## Availability

The software is available for all VU employees running macOS 10.12 and higher. If you're running a lower version of macOS, please upgrade.

## VU Software Center

Here is a quick link to the Adobe Lightroom Classic CC installer: [install Adobe Lightroom Classic CC](munki://detail-AdobeLightroomCC)

## License reset tool

Due to some licensing issues that we could not fix with the standard Adobe tooling, we now made available a License reset tool. This tool will remove all Adobe licensing information from your Mac. After the tool has erased the information, please run 'Update' in VU Software Center to automatically re-install the license package - your machine needs to be connected to a campus network.
