The license of SPSS 24 that is installed via VU Software Center is expiring at the end of July. If you start up SPSS you will see a notification stating that SPSS will expire in x days.

## Grace period

The VU ordered a new license, but it will not be available until the end of August. Luckily you will be able to use SPSS until the end of August due to the grace period of one month.

## New License for VU-owned computers

We will supply users of SPSS with a new license if the computer is owned by the VU or when the computer is whitelisted (owned by another university but allowed by the VU).

## SPSS license for privately owned computers

Please visit [Surfspot](https://www.surfspot.nl) to obtain a license for a privately owned computer.
