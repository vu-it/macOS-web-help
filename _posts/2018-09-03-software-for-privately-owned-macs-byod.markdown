Starting september 2018 VU Software Center has stopped offering licensed software to privately owned Macs. The reason is that the software vendors only allow the licenses to be installed on VU owned hardware. As a consequence, a number of popular packages like Microsoft Office and SPSS have been pulled from VU Software Center.

### Private Mac computers

To obtain licenses for software like Microsoft Office, SPSS or Adobe Creative Cloud, please visit the [SURFspot](https://www.surfspot.nl) site. Software is offered for a discounted price to VU empoyees and students.

### I have a VU owned Mac computer

If you have a VU owned laptop or desktop, you should see all licensed software in VU Software Center. If you only see a limited software selection (Microsoft Office is missing), please contact the servicedesk.
