DetectX Swift is available for all users running macOS 10.11 and higher.

DetectX Swift is a lightweight, on-demand dedicated search and troubleshooting tool that can identify malware, adware, keyloggers, potentially unwanted apps and potentially destabilising apps on a mac. It can also help to identify unknown and novel threats through its Profiler and History functions.

## Availability

The software is available for all VU employees running macOS 10.11 and higher. If you're running a lower version of macOS, please upgrade.

## Licensing

The DetectX Swift license installer is only available on the campus networks (wired or wireless), so make sure you are on a VU university network. The installed license remains valid when you're off campus.
