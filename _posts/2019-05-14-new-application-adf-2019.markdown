ADF 2019 is available for all users running macOS 10.10 and higher.

ADF is frequently used for studying transition metal complexes and molecules with heavy atoms, since all elements in the periodic table can be modeled accurately and efficiently with the ZORA relativistic approach and Slater Type orbital (STO) all-electron basis sets. With these features, ADF offers unique capabilities to predict molecular properties of nanoparticles and organic electronics materials.
