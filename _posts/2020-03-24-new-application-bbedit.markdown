BBEdit is now available via the VU Software Center for all Macs using VU Software Center. BBEdit is only available for Macs running macOS 10.13 or newer.

BBEdit has been made available as a replacement for TextWrangler, which is no longer supported in macOS Catalina. This replacement is part of an effort to make sure that all software provided by the VU is macOS Catalina compatible.

## VU Software Center
