TextMate 2 is now available via the VU Software Center for all Macs using VU Software Center. TextMate 2 is only available for Macs running macOS 10.13 or newer.

TextMate 2 has been made available as a replacement for TextMate, which is no longer supported in macOS Catalina. This replacement is part of an effort to make sure that all software provided by the VU is macOS Catalina compatible.
