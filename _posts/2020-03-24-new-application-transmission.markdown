Transmission is now available via the VU Software Center for all Macs using VU Software Center. Transmission is only available for Macs running macOS 10.13 or newer.

Transmission has been made available as a replacement for uTorrent, which is no longer supported in macOS Catalina. This replacement is part of an effort to make sure that all software provided by the VU is macOS Catalina compatible.

## VU Software Center

You can find Transmission in the VU Software Center. You can also open it by clicking [here](munki://detail-Transmission).
