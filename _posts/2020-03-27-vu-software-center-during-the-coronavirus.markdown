As a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the VU campus has been closed to all students and most staff. In order to facilitate students and staff being able to work from home, we have allowed some software to be downloaded from outside of the VU.

The following packages are now available for download outside of the VU through VU Software Center:

* Atlas.ti
* Stata 16
* Endnote X8
* Endnote X9

In addition, Mathematica is also no longer dependent on the campus license. You can obtain a personal license through the VU at no cost to you via the method described [here](https://munki.mac.vu.nl/manuals/Mathematica.pdf).


We are continually assessing how we can assist those working from home. Should you have any questions or suggestions, please contact the IT Servicedesk.
They are available on weekdays between 07:30 - 17:00 by [email](mailto:servicedesk.it@vu.nl) or by phone (+31205980000).
