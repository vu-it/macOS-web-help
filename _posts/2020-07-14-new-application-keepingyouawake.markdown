KeepingYouAwake is now available via the VU Software Center for all Macs using VU Software Center. KeepingYouAwake is only available for Macs running macOS 10.13 or newer.

KeepingYouAwake has been made available as a replacement for Caffeine, which is no longer being developed. In the interest of endpoint security, we are replacing Caffeine in order to make sure that all applications we provide receive regular software patches against any possible vulnerabilities.

We strongly recommend that users of Caffeine uninstall it, and install KeepingYouAwake in its place. The functionality remains the same.

## VU Software Center
