Adobe CC is returning to VU Software Center with 64-bit support!
The Adobe Creative Cloud application will be available in the VU Software Center for all VU Mac users running macOS 10.15 and higher from February 1st, 2021.

## Availability

The client software will be available for all VU-Owned macOS hardware running macOS 10.15 or later. The software does not include a license. You will have to request a license through the askIT portal.

## License information

Should you request a license, you will be able to log into the Adobe CC application using your VU email and password. The requested license will have been automatically assigned to your account, and you will be able to install any apps you wish to use through the Adobe CC application.

## Uninstalling Adobe CC

Should you wish to uninstall the Adobe CC application for any reason, please pay attention to the fact that you will first have to remove all apps installed through the Adobe CC application **before** removing the Adobe CC application through VU Software Center. The uninstall process will not complete until you have removed all Adobe CC apps from your computer.
