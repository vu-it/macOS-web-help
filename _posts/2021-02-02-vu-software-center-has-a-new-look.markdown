With the release of VU Software Center 5.3.0 today, you may notice that VU Software Center looks different.
That's right - VU Software Center has been refreshed to more closely resemble the Mac App Store in macOS Big Sur, and to match the new UI style in macOS Big Sur.

This update also adds improved compatibility with macOS Big Sur.
