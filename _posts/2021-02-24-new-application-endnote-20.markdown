EndNote 20 is available for all users running macOS 10.14 and higher.

### VU Software Center link

Please follow [this link](munki://detail-EndNote20) to download and install EndNote 20. While the EndNote 20 installer is usually only available on the campus networks (wired or wireless), it will temporarily be accessible from outside of the VU for as long as working/studying from home continues to be the norm.
